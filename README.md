# TRAVELLER CARGO PROBLEM #

<br/>
Programming Laboratory Spring Semester Project 1 Traveller Cargo Problem 
<br/>

# INTRODUCTÄ°ON #
<br/>

The program provides the products of any cargo company to its customers from the point of departure (dynamically entered by the user).
it finds 5 additional shortcuts for the shortest route. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used in the solution of the problem.
<br/>



# INSTALLING & USAGE #
<br/>

No setup required. There is 4 folder in "Project" folder.

1) "Intellij IDEA" for direct open with Intellij IDEA.
2) "NetBeans" for direct open with Apache Netbeans.
3) "Eclipse" for direct open with Eclipse IDE.
4) There is an executable java program named "Prolab-2-1.jar" in the "JAR" folder. 
   You can run by double click.

<br/>


When Program Executed:
1) Firstly you must enter how many city you will visit.( MAX 10).  

2) You must enter the code of starting city. Its mean cargo distribution center.

3) Finally you must enter the code of cities one by one you want to visit.

4) After entering all the entries, you will see two separate windows.
   The first one will show you the shortest 5 ways and costs and the duration of the program.
   The other larger window shows you the shortest 5 routes drawn on a map.
<br/>



# DEPENDENCIES #
<br/>

Java 14 must be installed on your system. 
<br/>


# TEST RESULTS #
<br/>
According to the complexity of the computation time of the program In tests;
<br/>
If 1 city will visit -> 0.067 second <br/>
If 2 city will visit -> 0.066 second <br/>
If 3 city will visit -> 0.077 second <br/>
If 4 city will visit -> 0.068 second <br/>
If 5 city will visit -> 0.068 second <br/>
If 6 city will visit -> 0.071 second <br/>
If 7 city will visit -> 0.081 second <br/>
If 8 city will visit -> 0.138 second <br/>
If 9 city will visit -> 0.550 second <br/>
If 10 city will visit -> 3.593 second <br/>

Warning! Times may vary depending on equipment status and route.
